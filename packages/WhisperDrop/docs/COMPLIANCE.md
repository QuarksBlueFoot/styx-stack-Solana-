# Styx Compliance Hooks (High Level)

Styx is a *Compliant Privacy Stack*:
- Optional audit keys (opt-in visibility)
- Selective disclosure flows (prove claims without leaking full state)
- Policy hooks (apps can enforce rules without logging secrets)
- Deterministic receipts (stable error codes + event summaries)

Styx does NOT promise anonymity on Solana L1.
It provides practical privacy primitives and rails with explicit trust models.
