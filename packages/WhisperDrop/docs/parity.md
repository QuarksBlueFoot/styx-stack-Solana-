# Parity Notes

This project aims for competitor parity without copying code.

## WhisperDrop inspirations (ideas only)

- "Merkle allowlists" common in token distributions: commit to a snapshot with a Merkle root.
- Privacy-first "claim tickets" delivered privately to keep the eligible set non-public.
- Selective reveal support patterns: users can reveal only what is needed to resolve support issues.

Implementation in this repo is original and built from first principles.
