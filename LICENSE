                           ORIGINALITY STATEMENT
================================================================================

The Virtual State Layer (VSL) architecture, inscribed state patterns, and all
novel primitives (Time Capsules, Ghost PDAs, CPI Inscribe, VTAs, Inscribed
Governance, Referral Trees) are ORIGINAL innovations created by Styx Stack.

While we acknowledge the broader Solana ecosystem:
- Light Protocol (ZK compression) - Different technology, different use case
- MagicBlock (ephemeral rollups) - Different technology, different use case

Our inscribed-state architecture is conceptually distinct and does NOT copy
or derive from these projects. VSL was independently developed as a novel
approach to privacy and rent-free state on Solana.
